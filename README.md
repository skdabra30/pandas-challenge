Pandas Homework analyzing PyCitySchools

Observations

The first and most obvious observation is that Charter schools perform better than District schools. This is suppurted by the fact that Charter schools have a greater percentage of students passing math and reading leading to a better percentage of overall students passing. 

The second observation, which is interesting, is that spending more per student does not relate to higher percentage of students passing math and reading. The lower the spending per student leads to higher percentage of students passing overall.
